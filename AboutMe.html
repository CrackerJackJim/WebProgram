<h1>Landon Boyd</h1>
<h2>Junior I.T. Major</h2>
    <p>
       I'm looking forward to web development, because I want to have a better general understanding of programming mechanics in general. But also I wish to be able to one day emulate the styles of older websites from late 80s to early 2000s, I find them quite charming. It would also simply be just fun to capture the aestethic and make some fun projects around those style concepts and ideas. Web development to me overall is something you can use to be creative in a logical way if that makes sense.

    <h2>Three things I want to Learn</h2>

    <div>
    <p>
        1. Better styling skills overall to be able to create clear and concise formatting <br>
        2. Better memorizization skills for programming lingo, because I can find it difficult remembering coding prompts <br>
        3. How to be a more efficient programmeras a whole.
